This text aims to give an introduction to select topics in discrete mathematics at a level appropriate for first or second year undergraduate math
majors, especially those who intend to teach middle and high school mathematics. The book began as a set of notes for the Discrete Mathematics
course at the University of Northern Colorado. This course serves both as
a survey of the topics in discrete math and as the “bridge” course for math
majors, as UNC does not offer a separate “introduction to proofs” course.
Most students who take the course plan to teach, although there are a
handful of students who will go on to graduate school or study applied
math or computer science. For these students the current text hopefully
is still of interest, but the intent is not to provide a solid mathematical
foundation for computer science, unlike the majority of textbooks on the
subject.
Another difference between this text and most other discrete math
books is that this book is intended to be used in a class taught using
problem oriented or inquiry based methods. When I teach the class, I will
assign sections for reading after first introducing them in class by using
a mix of group work and class discussion on a few interesting problems.
The text is meant to consolidate what we discover in class and serve as a
reference for students as they master the concepts and techniques covered
in the unit. None-the-less, every attempt has been made to make the text
sufficient for self study as well, in a way that hopefully mimics an inquiry
based classroom.
The topics covered in this text were chosen to match the needs of
the students I teach at UNC. The main areas of study are combinatorics,
sequences, logic and proofs, and graph theory, in that order. Induction is
covered at the end of the chapter on sequences. Most discrete books put
logic first as a preliminary, which certainly has its advantages. However, I
wanted to discuss logic and proofs together, and found that doing both
of these before anything else was overwhelming for my students given
that they didn’t yet have context of other problems in the subject. Also,
after spending a couple weeks on proofs, we would hardly use that at
all when covering combinatorics, so much of the progress we made was
quickly lost. Instead, there is a short introduction section on mathematical
statements, which should provide enough common language to discuss
the logical content of combinatorics and sequences.
Depending on the speed of the class, it might be possible to include
additional material. In past semesters I have included generating functions
(after sequences) and some basic number theory (either after the logic and
vii
viii
proofs chapter or at the very end of the course). These additional topics
are covered in the last chapter.
While I (currently) believe this selection and order of topics is optimal,
you should feel free to skip around to what interests you. There are
occasionally examples and exercises that rely on earlier material, but I
have tried to keep these to a minimum and usually can either be skipped
or understood without too much additional study. If you are an instructor,
feel free to edit the LATEX or PreTeXt source to fit your needs.
Improvements to the 3rd Edition.
In addition to lots of minor corrections, both to typographical and mathematical errors, this third edition includes a few major improvements,
including:
• More than 100 new exercises, bringing the total to 473. The selection
of which exercises have solutions has also been improved, which
should make the text more useful for instructors who want to assign
homework from the book.
• A new section in on trees in the graph theory chapter.
• Substantial improvement to the exposition in chapter 0, especially
the section on functions.
• The interactive online version of the book has added interactivity.
Currently, many of the exercises are displayed as WeBWorK problems,
allowing readers to enter answers to verify they are correct.
The previous editions (2nd edition, released in August 2016, and the
Fall 2015 edition) will still be available for instructors who wish to use
